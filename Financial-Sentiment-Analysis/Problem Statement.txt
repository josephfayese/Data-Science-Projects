FINANCIAL SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TOOL
==================================

Problem Statement:
------------------
Bitcoin and foreign exchange markets (specifically USD/NGN in Nigeria) are highly sensitive to
policy announcements, regulatory changes, economic news, and social media sentiment. Traders and
investors need real-time insights into how news and social media discussions might impact these
asset prices.

Currently, there is no comprehensive tool that:
1. Automatically collects relevant news from multiple sources (news feeds, Twitter, blogs)
2. Analyzes sentiment and potential market impact
3. Correlates sentiment with actual price movements
4. Provides actionable insights for Bitcoin and USD/NGN trading decisions

Business Objective:
-------------------
Develop an automated sentiment analysis tool that:
- Monitors news feeds, Twitter/X, and financial blogs for Bitcoin and Nigeria FX-related content
- Extracts and analyzes sentiment from policies and announcements
- Tracks real-time Bitcoin and USD/NGN price data
- Correlates sentiment scores with price movements
- Generates alerts and insights for potential market impacts

Target Users:
-------------
- Cryptocurrency traders and investors
- FX traders focused on Nigerian Naira
- Financial analysts and researchers
- Policy makers and regulators

Key Features:
-------------
1. Multi-source data collection (News APIs, Twitter, RSS feeds)
2. Natural Language Processing for sentiment analysis
3. Real-time price tracking (Bitcoin, USD/NGN)
4. Sentiment-price correlation analysis
5. Automated alert system for significant events
6. Historical data analysis and visualization
7. Customizable keywords and sources
